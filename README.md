# **Sickozell plugin for 4ms metamodule**  

SickozellMM is a 4ms metamodule port of SickoCV plugin for VCV rack.

It is built to work with metamodule firmware v2.0 (not tested with previous ones)

Modules name ending with "L" stands for 'lite edition' and means that is optimized to work monophonic instead of regular SickoCV polyphonic modules, just to save CPU on Metamodule hardware.

## **Consider donating**  
The work necessary to develop these modules required many hours of work and many sleepless nights.  
Sickozell plugin is and will always remain free, but if you find it useful, consider donating even just a coffee by following this [payPal](https://paypal.me/sickozell) link.  
Thanks.
